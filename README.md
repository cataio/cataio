I’ve learned that implementing new technology is the easy part—making it stick is the real challenge. Over my 20+ years in networking and security, I’ve focused on practical adoption and measurable outcomes, spanning everything from 5G R&D in San Jose to multi-cloud transformations in EMEA.

I specialize in bridging code-to-cloud security with AI-driven networking solutions. My approach ties left-shift guardrails (SAST, secrets scanning) to real runtime data, so teams prioritize what genuinely matters. I’ve rolled out CNAPP, CSPM, and CWP guardrails for GCP, Palo Alto, and CrowdStrike. I’ve also led projects integrating Splunk, Chronicle, Sentinel, and CrowdStrike NG SIEM into large-scale data lakes, ensuring holistic visibility across IT and OT.

As a manager, I’ve built high-performing teams by emphasizing incentives, lean methods, and agile execution—whether it’s a global SOC operation or an IP/MPLS backbone upgrade. My experience at Ericsson taught me to align technical demands with diverse stakeholder needs, from CxOs to R&D engineering teams. At Secureworks, I managed SOC operations, threat intelligence, and incident response for Fortune 500 clients, driving large-scale cloud upgrades and 5G trials across multiple regions.

I see the network not just as infrastructure but as a strategic enabler—especially in an AI-native, software-driven era. If you’re exploring ways to strengthen cloud security or elevate your enterprise network’s capabilities, I’d be happy to connect.
